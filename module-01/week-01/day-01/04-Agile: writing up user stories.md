You will be organized as teams and be assigned a mentor. Each team will select a theme to work with and write the requirements (user stories) for developing that theme.

### :clipboard: Instructions

Select three screens from your theme and for each screen write three user stories of some aspects of components, overall you will write 9 user stories. Make sure to write your user story using the following formula:

"As a <type of user: who is this story for>, I would like <some goal: what they want to do> so that <some reason: why they want to do it>." , risks, requirements and the acceptance criteria with the required steps for passing quality assurance.
  
User stories will be published on the corresponding github board.
