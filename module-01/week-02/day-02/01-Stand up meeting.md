# Stand up meeting

All team members are required to attend scrum meetings. Since both the Scrum Master and product owner are committed team members, they are expected to attend and participate. Anyone else outside of the team is allowed to attend, but is there only to listen.

The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:

What did you do yesterday?
What will you do today?
Are there any impediments in your way?

By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today, the team gains an excellent understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.

If a programmer stands up and says, "Today, I will finish the data storage module," everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he finished. This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of these commitments, and that their commitments are to one another.
Any impediments that are raised in the scrum meeting become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.

## :pencil2: Scrum Report Structure

Yesterday:
- ticket ID and a brief description what I was doing 

Today:
- What I'm going to do today

Blockers:
- If I have a problem that stops me or if I need something from someone urgently

### :bulb: Example

Yesterday:
- [BR-113] 2.7 Promociones - Acceso al m√≥dulo de promociones: En Code Review
- [BR-114] 2.7 Promociones - Activar / desactivar promociones: Trabajando en la parte del Gateway

Today:
- [BR-114] 2.7 Promociones - Activar / desactivar promociones: Trabajando la parte del API y terminar el Gateway

Blockers:
- Existe un step del desactivar promociones cuando se encuentra vencida, me gustaria que me aclararan como pensaron esa parte, Seria el Gateway quien tenria un proceso corriendo que cheque las promociones cada cierto tiempo o seria del lado de la API?
