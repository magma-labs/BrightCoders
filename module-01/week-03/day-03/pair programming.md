## Pair programming

Yo will continue working on this project, but know you will be aplying an agile technique known as pair programming.

On this technique two programers work together on a same ticket. The twoe programmes switch frequently on the following two roles:

* Driver. The one that writes code
* Observer. The one that reviews the code as it is written

There are several benefits associated to this technique and also different setups or variantions in which it can be implemented. To learn more about pair programming refer to the recommended links section.
