## Pair programming

Yo will continue working on this project, but know you will be aplying an agile technique known as pair programming.

On this technique two programers work together on a same ticket. The two programmes switch frequently on the following two roles:

* Driver. The one that writes code
* Observer. The one that reviews the code as it is written

**Rotation**
Rotating team members while pairing is also an important practice, thus during this activity team members will start rotating.

There are several benefits associated to this technique and also different setups or variantions in which it can be implemented. To learn more about pair programming refer to the recommended links section.

* Setup your development environment so you can start practicing pair programming
* You will work on pairs on your sprint tickets and rotate frequently on the driver and observer roles.
* Every three days one member of each team will rotate. This is a team work together for two days and on the third day one of them rotate.
* To make sure you pair with as much team members as posible, please register on this table with whom you have already pair so you can also identify who is missing.
