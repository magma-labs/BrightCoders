# Demo preparation

At the end of each sprint a Sprint Review Meeting is celebrated. This meeting is structured in two parts:

* Customer Review or Demo. The porpuse of this meeting is for the team to show what you have achieved on this sprint.
* Team Retrospective. Is a meeting facilitated by the ScrumMaster at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive.

We are about to conclude this second sprint and now you need to get ready for your demonstration.

## Customer Review or Demo

The purpose of this meeting is for the team to show the customers and stakeholders the work they have accomplished over the sprint. The meeting is facilitated by the product owner but it is not uncommon to have the team members run the meeting. In this meeting, the customers should be reviewing the following data:

* The work the team committed to delivering
* The work they completed
* Key decisions that were made during the iteration/sprint (this may include technical, market-driven, requirements, etc, and * can be decisions made by the team, the product owner, the customers, or anyone else)
* Project metrics (code coverage, etc)
* Demo of the work itself
* Priority review (for the next iteration/sprint)

Most agile teams will ask customers to accept the work right then and there; after all, it meets the definition of done and should be potentially shippable at this point. Some customers, however, want time to use the application before pushing it out, so some teams opt to give their customers up to a week to formally accept the work. It is very important to get acceptance – don’t skimp on this.

The duration of the customer review meeting varies depending on sprint length. For a one-week sprint, the meeting should last about one hour; for a two-week sprint, two hours. Teams running four-week (30 day) sprints should allow four hours for this meeting.
