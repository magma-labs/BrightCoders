* Activity tracking

## Pair programming. 

We will rotate the members of the teams and will be doing pairing, for this it is necessary that among you choose and configure your development environment, it could be atomic, sublime or any other, there exists different setups you could use for this activity. You will configure your environment and start exploring how it works.

## Activity tracking

Registering daily activities on a daily baisis is a common practice on our working scheme. At the end of or retrospective meeting we will be detailing why is important to register daily activities. The tool that we will be using this time is [TopTracker](https://www.toptal.com/tracker/). For now lets just explore how it works, it will be until the begining of our next project when we will start registering daily our activities.
