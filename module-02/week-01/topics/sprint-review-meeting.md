# Sprint Review Meeting

At the end of each sprint a Sprint Review Meeting is celebrated. This meeting is structured in two parts:

* Customer Review or Demo. The porpuse of this meeting is for the team to show what you have achieved on this sprint.
* Team Retrospective. Is a meeting facilitated by the ScrumMaster at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive.

## Customer Review or Demo

The purpose of this meeting is for the team to show the customers and stakeholders the work they have accomplished over the sprint. The meeting is facilitated by the product owner but it is not uncommon to have the team members run the meeting. In this meeting, the customers should be reviewing the following data:

* The work the team committed to delivering
* The work they completed
* Key decisions that were made during the iteration/sprint (this may include technical, market-driven, requirements, etc, and * can be decisions made by the team, the product owner, the customers, or anyone else)
* Project metrics (code coverage, etc)
* Demo of the work itself
* Priority review (for the next iteration/sprint)

Most agile teams will ask customers to accept the work right then and there; after all, it meets the definition of done and should be potentially shippable at this point. Some customers, however, want time to use the application before pushing it out, so some teams opt to give their customers up to a week to formally accept the work. It is very important to get acceptance – don’t skimp on this.

The duration of the customer review meeting varies depending on sprint length. For a one-week sprint, the meeting should last about one hour; for a two-week sprint, two hours. Teams running four-week (30 day) sprints should allow four hours for this meeting.

# Retrospective and Sprint planning meeting

The sprint retrospective is a meeting facilitated by the ScrumMaster at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive. The sprint review looks at what the team is building, whereas the retrospective looks at how they are building it.

The retrospective includes three main questions/points for discussion:

- What went well during the sprint cycle?
- What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
- What could we do differently to improve?

The sprint retrospective is an important mechanism that allows a team to continuously evolve and improve throughout the life of a project.

It is important that everyone, including the team, product owner, and ScrumMaster, get a chance to air their opinions in an open, honest, yet constructive atmosphere. It often also helps management to get feedback from the team about the work and progress of project.

##Key elements of the sprint retrospective:
Process improvements are made at the end of every sprint. This ensures that the project team is always improving the way it works.

The retrospective is a collaborative process among all members, including the team, the product owner, and the ScrumMaster.

* All team members identify what went well and what could be improved.
* The team members discuss the process that they are following and give any suggestions for improvement.
* The team members discuss any other ideas that could improve their productivity.
* The ScrumMaster prioritizes actions and lessons learned based on team direction.
* The retrospective supports team formation and bonding, particularly as any areas of conflict can be identified and dealt with.
* The retrospective helps build the team's sense of ownership and its self-management.

## Outcome
At the end of the retrospective we need to have a list of:

- Action Items for the PM
- Action Items for Team/Developers
