# Building a storefront using shopify

Time to put in practice all you learned last week!

You will start building your storefront using shopify. As agreed on our sprint planning meeting you will start taking stories from your backlog and work on them. 

Do not forget to keep as updated as posible your git repository and SCRUM board.
