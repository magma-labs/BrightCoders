# Javascript, Bash, Shopify and Sass 

One of the objectives of this program is to develop technical and soft skills that facilitate your integration to a work team such as MagmaLabs or similar companies.

During this continous learning activity, the technical skills you will be working on are:

* Javascript
* Sass
* Bash

This activity is not necessarily individual, you can organize yourself and perform some tasks individually and others as a team.

## Javascript

Javascript is a technical skill and highly valued by companies. To lear more about this language, you should start by reading the first book of the series You Do not Know JS, titled [UP & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). *"JavaScript is awesome. It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even sufficiently). When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding. These books aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and should, deeply know."* (Taken from the book's preface)

## Bash

This tool is widely used by professional developers, so it is important to know how to use it beyond its basic commands. To learn more about bash, you will attend the [Shell scripting with bash course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/bash-shell-scripting) which is available on the pluralsigth platform.

## Sass
* SASS. For building your store front using shopify you will require Sass. To learn the basics of Sass, use the following resource:

`npm install -g learn-sass`
