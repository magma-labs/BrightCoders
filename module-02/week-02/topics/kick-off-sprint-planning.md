# Project Kick-off and Sprint Planning Meeting

## Project Kick-off

An Agile Project Kick-off is designed to:

* build a shared understanding of the Project Vision: what you’ll deliver for your organisation and your customers
* bond the team as a collaborative unit aligned behind the Vision
* ruthlessly prioritise only those elements that will deliver these outcomes
* let you set expectations about what will be delivered within your organisation
* do all this quickly with a view to delivering a working product as soon as possible.
* It’s often the first time people have met so it’s a chance to get to know each other. Everyone has input and works together to give the project the soundest foundation possible.

## Sprint planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
