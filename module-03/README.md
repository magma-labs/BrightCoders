# Ruby on Rails Programming

On this module you will learn how to build modern web applications using Ruby on Rails. Before diving into RoR you will first learn how to program with Ruby. Along this module you will also join a team to contribute to a project.

Thus, the following three sectrions are part of this module:

### Learning Ruby
*Ruby is dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.* Definition taken from [Ruby's official web page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). 

This section includes different activities and challenges that will help you to understand andthear the Ruby programming language. This section is not only introductory but will take you to the next level by requiring you to develop some interesting applications.

### Learning Ruby on Rails
... work in progress..

### The Project
Each of you will join to a team working on a project. Distribution of hackers will depend on the number of projects available and the number of participants required for each project. Each project has a Project Manager or Leader who will give you all the information required to understand the projects and also asing you tasks with deadlines. For all matters related to the project, you will address and respond to the person responsible for your project.

Do not forget that you are still part of the MagmaHacker program, this activity is part of your trainning, 
and therefore also responsabilities to fulfill but also support from your mentors. Make sure to complete all tasks assigned to you on the ruby and ruby on rails components and support yourself in our mentoring team in case you need help for learning ruby, ruby on rails or in topics related to your project.

## How to work on this module

### The Project 
Projects have different duration, deadlines and workoad. Therefor, the speed at which each one of you will advance may vary. 
In order not to interfere with the compromises assinged to you in your projects, the activities that have been defined in the ruby and ruby on rails sections do not have a defined a deadline. In other words there are no excuses for not fulfilling the tasks of your projects in time.

### Ruby and Ruby on Rails Tasks
At the end of both, ruby and ruby on rails sections you must develop some tasks. Once you consider you have  completed  a task you should notify (on slack) to mentors that you have finished that task so they can review your code, give you feedback or aprobe your task. One task is considered as finished only once you have attended mentors all mentors comments and they have informed to you that there is nothing else to do. Once your tasks has been approved by your mentors you should notify (on slack) so we can track who has finished which tasks.

### Ruby and Ruby on Rails Demos
Once all MagmaHackers have completed a same tasks a demo will be organised so you can present what you have done.
