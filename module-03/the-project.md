# The Project

Each of you will join to a team working on a project. Distribution of hackers will depend on the number of projects available and the number of participants required for each project. Each project has a Project Manager or Leader who will give you all the information required to understand the projects and also asing you tasks with deadlines. For all matters related to the project, you will address and respond to the person responsible for your project.

Do not forget that you are still part of the MagmaHacker program, this activity is part of your trainning, 
and therefore also responsabilities to fulfill but also support from your mentors. Make sure to complete all tasks assigned to you on the ruby and ruby on rails sections and support yourself in our mentoring team in case you need help for learning ruby, ruby on rails or in topics related to your project.
