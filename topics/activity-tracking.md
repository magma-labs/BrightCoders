# Activity Tracking

Keeping a daily registration on our daily activities is an important requirement in most projects as this allow us to be transparent with our clients but also to provide of valuable information to our team and project manager.

**For registering your daily activities use the following format:**

`
[project code][points] topic
`

**For example:**
`
[MH2018-10][3] Feature/featured categories shopify
`

**If you attended a meeting  or workshop you can register it as follows:**

`
[][] meeting - story grooming
[][] workshop - an introduction to shopify
`

**Similarly, if you are doing code review:**
`
[][] Code Review - Feature/featured categories shopify
`
